# JavaScript Fundamentals Code Quiz

## Description

The JavaScript quiz is a web-based application that presents a quiz game to the user. The quiz game has a total of 5 multiple-choice questions related to the fundamentals of JavaScript, and the user must answer all of them correctly to receive a high score. The user has a limited amount of time to complete the quiz, which is set at 75 seconds. The quiz is timed and there is a timer on the screen to show the time remaining. The user can see the question on the screen, along with multiple answers to choose from.

If the user selects the correct answer, their score increases by 7 points, and if they select the wrong answer, their score decreases by 1 point, and they lose 3 seconds from the timer.
At the end of the quiz, the user is presented with their final score, and they are given the option to submit their initials to be included in the high score record. The high score board allows the user to track their personal scores, and it displays the top 5 scores.

The web page is designed to work with different screen sizes, and the user can access it through a single link. The code is written in JavaScript and it uses a variety of techniques and functions to create the quiz game and to keep track of the user's score and time.


## Your Task

At some point in your journey to become a full-stack web developer, you’ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment&mdash;perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help familiarize you with these tests and allow you to use the skills covered in this module, this Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

This week’s coursework will equip you with all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student

SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Note on external help and additional sources.

Thank you to Bootcamp tutor Erik Hoverstein, and several of the AskBCS Learning Assistants for helping me digest and understand concepts, answering specifc questions, and reviewing sections of my code I was unsure of. In addition, I got a lot of guidance from the Youtube Series Web Dev Simplified (how to build a quiz app with javascript).
